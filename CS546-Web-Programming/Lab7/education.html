          I attended a public high school where I was able to develop
          friendships with students who shared similar interests. I met some
          great friends and learned a lot about myself through these
          experiences.

          I attended that school for 10 years. The memories are really vivid. I
          remember the teachers who taught us well. I also remember the friends
          I had during those days. I am glad that I experienced that school
          because I got to meet some great people. Those experiences helped me
          build my character.
