    <h1>One of my favorite Traveling stories</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        One of my most embarrassing funny stories happened while I was
        backpacking South America — specifically during a 4×4 tour from San
        Pedro de Atacama in Chile to Uyuni, Bolivia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trip takes you through the desert for three days to see otherworldly
        sites like hot pink lagoons where flamingos search for food, an
        abandoned train graveyard, and, the highlight, the world-famous Uyuni
        Salt Flats.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the trip, you share a car with four or five other people. At one
        point, I was sitting in the front seat and it was getting really hot in
        the car. Our driver didn’t speak English, but I spoke decent Spanish —
        or at least I thought I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Estoy caliente!” I said, looking right at the driver. To my confusion,
        instead of rolling down a window, he looked horrified…or maybe confused?
        I decided it was probably my Indian accent confusing him. “Estoy
        caliente!” I said again, this time in what I thought was a more
        local-sounding accent. He looked even more horrified-slashed-confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the one native Spanish speaker in the car spoke up from the
        back: “Umm, I’m assuming you’re not meaning to tell the driver you’re
        horny, right?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, the way I was saying “I’m hot” literally translated to,
        well, another meaning of the phrase. As I turned bright red, I decided I
        didn’t really need the window open and would just sit in silence and try
        to disappear by melting in the car seat.
      </p>

        But hey, when it comes to learning a language while traveling,
        embarrassing mistakes can certainly be a great teacher. Plus, I can add
        this to my list of hilarious vacation stories to share at parties.
