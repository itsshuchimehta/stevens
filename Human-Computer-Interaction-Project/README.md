# critiQs
- critiQs is a web application that allows users to view online content descriptions and post their reviews. The app is designed for cinephiles who want to share their thoughts on the latest releases and discover new movies/shows to watch.

- The app features a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and find the movies they are looking for. Users can search for movies by title, genre, or year of release. The app also has a recommendation system that suggests movies based on the user's preferences.

- Users can post reviews for movies they have watched, giving them the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others. Each review includes a rating system, where users can rate the movie or a show on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

- critiQs also include a detailed description of each movie, including the cast, director, release date, and a brief synopsis of the plot. Users can also view trailers, posters, and other related media.
